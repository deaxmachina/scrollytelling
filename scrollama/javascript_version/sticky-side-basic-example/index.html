          We start with some simple chart. Here we just have some random circles inside 
          the sticky graph container. The first step shows their initial arrangement. 
          The size of the text container should be as big as the text inisde it, rather than 
          a fixed size, or varying only dependent on the screeen size. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <p>
          For the second step, we want something to change in the graph. For example, we show the 
          same data for a different subset, or different year, etc. The important point is, the 
          graph is the same and only the attributes of the element and/or the data is changing. 
          Here we just vary the radius.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <p>
          For the third step, we want to re-arrange the graph. Here we move the circles to the bottom 
          and change the radius. This is supposed to be a different graph. How could we make a 
          more complex one..?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" data-step="4">
        <p>
          Some random last step. Here we move the graph back to its original arrangement.
        </p>
