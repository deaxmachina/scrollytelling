      <span class="line"></span>
      This orange panel gets pinned when its top edge hits the top 
      of the viewport, then the line's animation is linked with the 
      scroll position until it has traveled 100% of the viewport's 
      height (<code>end: "+=100%"</code>), then the orange panel is 
      unpinned and normal scrolling resumes. Padding is added 
      automatically to push the rest of the content down so that 
      it catches up with the scroll when it unpins. You can set 
      <code>pinSpacing: false</code> to 
      prevent that if you prefer.
